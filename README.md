Project Name: 30MFF Website
Project Description: 
The project is a website dedicated to displaying and advertising a short film titled 'Weather for One' The film is centred around the theme of finding a balance between work and personal lifestyle, particulalry by honing in on the concept of personalized seld-care. My aim was for the user to experience a calming visualization of what it is like to create a safe and comfortable space for oneself. 


Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.
I wrote a short poem about the film to add to the artistic experience. I then used a color scheme that created a calming environment. To make users feel even more welcome, I included a story describing how the film came to be, added a page for the cast members' bios, and a page with details about how to contact the people involved with the fil. 

Reflection/Evaluation: I'm very happy with the final version. It looks artsy and I can see my personality in it. It also looks clean and is easy to navigate.
