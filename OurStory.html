  <p class = "about" >

    This film was inspired by the contious, up and down journey that is finding th belance between work and life in college.
    The actors are quite familiar with drifting off during classes, struggling to start or finish an essay due at midnight, getting "distracted"
    by a magazine or guitar sitting in the corner.... We noticed that our stories are different, but share a commonality: we were looking for a way to
    nurture the self amidst college chaos. We were all on a journey, and they were individualâ€“ unique to each of us. The uniqueness of these paths led us
    to creating this film, and titling it ;Weather for One' because we wanted to emhpasie the importance, valuen and beauty that lies in creating self-care
    that is truly personalized to you. We share this film with the hopes that you might resonate with it, and attempt to 'craft your own journey, and create
    your own weather'. Enjoy!
